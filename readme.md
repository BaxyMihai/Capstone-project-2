I always had a passion for technology, 
            but I never knew where to start because I never had any 
            influences. in my 30s I decided to learn web development 
            with teacher Angela Yu on udemy and that's how I became a 
            self-taught web developer


                                        I created this project only with bootstrap. It's not perfect, but neither are we.


This project was created with grid and flexbox. An invitation from my son for his birthday that I have also used.

The project that the teacher gave us was not complicated, so I chose a more complicated version to test my skills on the grid.
